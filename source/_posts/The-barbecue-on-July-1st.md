On July 1st ,2025,Tuesdayï¼ŒSunny

Ltt and I were getting ready to  go for a walk  after work ,We decided to have some barbecue  downstaits.We saw a Barbecue restaurant on Douyin, it have a fifty yuan grilled meat set meal.it was about two or three kilometers away.

We originally planned to take a bus there,but bus did not arrive for a long time .Finally,I decided to walk over .It tooks us almost forty minutes to walk there.

But when i arrived  there ,i found the fifty package only included a choice of two out of  three options.How ridiculous!

Ltt bought two bottles of beer from the shop of side.and ordered two skewers of chicken wings and a bowl of fried noodles.With the twenty skewers of grilled meat , twenty skewers of salted tendons and a plate of vegetables dishes in set meal.We ate our fill,and spend a total of seventy-seven yuan in the end.

When we left, I bought a bottle of water , we also decided to walk home,when we were walking about halfway through,it started to drizzle.It stopped after three or four minutes.

We got home at around ten o'clock finally.took a bath ,played phone for a while,

and we went to sleep.

Good night!
